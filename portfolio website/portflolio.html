	<h5><li>I have an older sister and two younger brothers. As well I have a dog named Melissa who is 6 years old. I have a strong love for animals since I was little and hope to become a vet when I grow up.I attend the school <a href="http://www.kippnyc.org"> KIPP NYC College Prep </a>.I enjoy being creative and tend to buy books that require me to  challenge my creativity in different ways.I specifically like <a href="http://www.kerismith.com"> Keri Smith </a> books. I am Mexican, which is also where my love for playing soccer came from and I love the food of my culture. I especially like to eat tostadas and posole. Lastly, I have played the violin 6 years and I enjoy doing it because it gives me a voice for myself showing my ability. </li></h5>
