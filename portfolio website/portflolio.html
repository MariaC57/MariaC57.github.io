<h2> My Culture </h2>

<h5> The thing I love most about my culture is the food. I just love that my culture enjoys spice because not many cultures have almost all their candy be spicy. As well as the food has to include some sort of spice I especially love the corn where they put mayonnaise,cheese, and the chili powder. In addition I love the dishes posole and tostadas I can eat them all the time. I am also a big cheese lover and most of the dishes consist of creme or cheese. I have started to learn how to cook some of these dishes since in my cuture the women have to learn how to cook  </h5>

	<h2> My Passions </h2>

	<h5> 1)I am very passioniate on advocating for animals in order to stop animal cruelty and animal testing. I do not like that companies think its humane to test on aminals when they suffer for it. One does not need to kept animals captive only to benefit themselves to make money. If the abuse of a humane is punishable so should the act of abusing animals.  </h5>

	<h5> 2)As well as informing people that Pit Bulls are not an "aggressive" breed. Many people do not understand that the character of a dog reflects the way the human trained it and treated it.s  </h5>
